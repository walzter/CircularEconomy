## Representation of a Circular Econonmy of processes & materials with a Bipartite graph structure 


The system will include the following: 

- Process-Material Data 
- map to bipartite graph 
- mapping to Network 
- k-nn for nearest neighbors 
- mapping  + k-nn Network 
- Provide Recommendation 
- List of Recommendations (output) 
- User (input) 
- Feedback 
- Locally update graph in the mapping network
